## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of Volis to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNarHakobyan%2Fvolis&env=AUTH_SECRET&envDescription=Learn%20more%20about%20environment%20variables&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNarHakobyan%2Fvolis%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.example&demo-title=Volis&demo-description=A%20modern%20tool%20for%20matching%20CVs%20with%20job%20requirements%20and%20providing%20detailed%20analysis.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.vercel.ai&stores=[{%22type%22:%22blob%22}])

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Volis. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your Volis application should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
